# Default properties that should be fit for development execution
#
# To set up the project, DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
# Override properties by creating build.properties in this directory and
# defining host-specific properties that override the ones in this file
#
# The Phing build script, build.xml, takes care of substituting these values
# into the PHP source files.
# Syntax: https://www.phing.info/docs/guide/trunk/PropertyFileFormat.html

# Used by build.xml for writable directories
# We don't use host.os or os.name for explicitness
